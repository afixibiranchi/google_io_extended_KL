    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern object recognition models have millions of parameters and can take weeks to fully train. Transfer learning is a technique that shortcuts a lot of this work by taking a fully-trained model for a set of categories like ImageNet, and retrains from the existing weights for new classes. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, Google's Inception-V3 pretrained model for Image Classification will be used. Inception v3 is a trained for the [ImageNet](http://image-net.org/) Large Visual Recognition Challenge using the data from 2012, and it can differentiate between 1,000 different classes, like Dalmatian or dishwasher.\n",
    "\n",
    "The chart below shows how the data flows in the Inception v3 model, which is a Convolutional Neural Network with many layers and a complicated structure. The [research paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.00567v3.pdf) gives more details on how the Inception model is constructed and why it is designed that way.\n",

    "Inception model is actually quite capable of extracting useful information from an image. So we can instead train the Inception model using another data-set, in for this notebook the Cat vs Dog dataset. But it takes several weeks using a very powerful and expensive computer to fully train the Inception model on a new data-set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can instead re-use the pre-trained Inception model and merely replace the layer that does the final classification. This is called Transfer Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Though it's not as good as a full training run, this is surprisingly effective for many applications, and can be run in as little as thirty minutes on a laptop, without requiring a GPU. \n",
